# MLOps Pipeline Improvements

## LLMOps Best Practices

### CI/CD for LLMs

*   [x] **Model Versioning:** Implement robust model versioning using a tool like DVC or MLflow. Track model weights, configurations, and training data.
*   [x] **Automated Testing:**  Include automated tests for model performance, bias, and security. Use a dedicated testing framework.
*   [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and manage infrastructure using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
*   [ ] **Monitoring and Observability:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of model performance, resource utilization, and error rates.

### Specific Improvements

*   [ ]  Improve model evaluation metrics.
*   [ ]  Implement shadow deployment for new models.
*   [ ]  Automate data validation.
